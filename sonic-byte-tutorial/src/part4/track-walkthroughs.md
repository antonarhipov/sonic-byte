## How to Use This Section

Each track walkthrough covers:

1. **Overview** — Purpose in the album, key characteristics
2. **Sound Design** — The specific sounds and why they were chosen
3. **Patterns** — Drum, bass, and melodic patterns
4. **Arrangement** — Section-by-section breakdown
5. **Hacker Challenges** — Modifications for you to try

## Suggested Reading Order

**If you want to learn progressively:**
1. Start with **Track 01** (System Override) — the simplest structure
2. Then **Track 03** (Chrome Cathedral) — introduces atmosphere
3. Then **Track 05** (Midnight Protocol) — introduces melody focus
4. Then **Track 07** (Core Meltdown) — combines everything

**If you want specific techniques:**
- Double-time drums → Track 02 (Nerve Damage)
- Atmospheric effects → Track 03 (Chrome Cathedral)
- Hook/signature sounds → Track 04 (Skull Fracture)
- Arpeggios → Track 05 (Midnight Protocol)
- Half-time/slow power → Track 06 (Void Walker)
- Ethereal leads → Track 07 (Core Meltdown)
- Fade-out arrangement → Track 08 (Terminal Velocity)

## Running the Code

Each track's complete code is available as a `.rb` file:

1. Open Sonic Pi
2. Copy the track code into a buffer
3. Press Run (or Cmd+R / Alt+R)
4. Listen and follow along with the walkthrough

## Experimentation Encouraged

As you read each walkthrough, try:

- **Changing one parameter** — What happens if cutoff is 60 instead of 80?
- **Swapping patterns** — What if Track 01's drums used Track 02's pattern?
- **Adjusting arrangement** — What if the break was longer?
- **Combining elements** — Can you merge ideas from different tracks?

The best way to learn is to break things, then fix them.
