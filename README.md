### About

*Synthetic Apocalypse* is an 8-track album (a "Sonic Byte") created entirely in [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/), a live coding music synthesizer. The album explores dark clubbing, industrial electronic, and darksynth territories, drawing inspiration from artists like **Irving Force**, **Noisecream**, **Gesaffelstein**, **1788-L**, and **REZZ**.

Each track is a standalone `.rb` file that can be run directly in Sonic Pi.

### Tracklist

| # | Title | BPM | Key | Description |

| 07 | **CORE MELTDOWN** | 106 | G Minor | The album's climax - peak-time destroyer. Dark synth bass with beautiful ethereal melodies. |
| 08 | **TERMINAL VELOCITY** | 100 | D Minor | Cinematic finale returning to D Minor. Intense, driving, fading into darkness. |

### Musical Philosophy

The album follows Dark Clubbing production principles:

- **Heavy, punishing bass** - Clean sub frequencies with gritty midrange
- **Industrial textures** - Metallic percussion, noise sweeps, dark atmospheres
- **DJ-functional structure** - Clean intros/outros, 16/32-bar phrases
- **Tension and release** - Builds, breakdowns, and impactful drops
- **Cyberpunk aesthetics** - Dark, futuristic, aggressive
